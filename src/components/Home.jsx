          Which is awesome news because you get to keep your money instead of
          spending it all on nonsense. Hurray!
        </p>
        <p>
          It&apos;s also important to note that the dev was making this at 1 AM
          and after finishing the shop page he decided to leave this blank.

          If you want to see some interesting stuff (maybe???) go click on
          &quot;Shop&quot; on the navigation bar. Good night.
